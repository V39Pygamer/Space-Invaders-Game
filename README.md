# Space-Invaders-Game

### Hello guys I am V39 Pygamer and I have created my first project using Pygame, a module in Python. You might never know that it is very easy to create a game in Python if you know the basics of the language. This is made by looking at a youtube video and was very helpful in teaching the basics of Pygame.







### If you want to check out the video which I saw to make the game click  [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWpgLFMI7w).


### If you want to try the game makesure you have Python and Pygame installed. To install Python go to [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads). To install Pygame on Windows go to CMD (Command Prompt) and give the command "pip install pygame"

## The controls of the game:-
* Left arrow key to move left
* Right arrow key to move right
* Space bar to shoot bullets at the enemies

## Please create an issue if you had any problems

# ENJOY !
